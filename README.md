# About

**BOXXLE** is a game.
**BOXXLE** is a puzzle.
**BOXXLE** is the go-anywhere brain teaser for the Game Boy system that you just can't put down.
The game is based on moving crates around in a warehouse.
But manual labour won't win the game: it takes brain power to move boxes into their proper spaces to clean up the room and get to the next screen... and the next... and the next!

## Create levels

After **Level 10** the levels will switch from the actual levels from **Boxxle** to user created levels.
The layout is as follows:

    #####
    #S..#
    #.21# ###
    #.3.# #x#
    ###.###x#
     ##....x#
     #...#..#
     #...####
     #####
     1 - 3,2 --> 7,3
     2 - 2,2 --> 7,4
     3 - 3,2 --> 7,5
'#' is a wall
'S' is the starting point
'1' is the 1st box
'x' is the end point

The co-ordinates for the boxes and their end points are as follows:
across (starting from zero) and down (starting from zero).

Submit levels on the comments (for the time being).

Note: At some point, I'll start using the Sok format.
